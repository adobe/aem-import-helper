# AEM Import Helper

A helpful companion for importing your site to AEM.

### Features

- Run large [import](#import) jobs with AEM Import as a Service ([API docs](https://opensource.adobe.com/spacecat-api-service/#tag/import)).
- [Bundle](#bundle) your import scripts.
- Develop import scripts with ease using AI-assisted [commands](#assistant).

## Install

Preferably as a dev dependency, but it can be used globally as well:

```
npm install aem-import-helper --save-dev
```

## Usage

### Import

Create a file (named `urls.txt` below) which contains a list of all URLs to import, one per line. 

Set your environment variables (either in your shell profile or in a `.env` file):

```
export AEM_IMPORT_API_KEY=your-import-api-key
```

Add an npm script entry to your Edge Delivery project's `package.json`:

```
"import": "aem-import-helper import"
```

Run the script:

```
npm run import -- --urls tools/importer/urls.txt --importjs tools/importer/import.js
```

The `import.js` file you provide will be automatically bundled and sent to the Import as a Service API, so referencing
other local scripts (such as transformers) is supported.

Once complete, a pre-signed URL to download the import result (as a .zip archive) from S3 will be printed to the console.

#### SharePoint upload

Optionally, the [m365 CLI](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/) can be installed and configured to upload the import result to SharePoint.
You will need your `tenantId` and the `clientId` of a [Microsoft Entra application](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-own-identity/) (on your SharePoint) to setup the CLI:

```
m365 setup
m365 login
```

Copy a link from SharePoint to the directory you'd like to upload to. This can be done from the SharePoint web UI, via the "Copy link" button.
Your new link should take the following form: `https://example.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/example/Shared%20Documents/destination-directory`

Once logged in to SharePoint with the `m365` CLI, pass the SharePoint link as a param to the aem-import-helper:

```
npm run import -- --urls urls.txt --sharepointurl https://example.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/example/Shared%20Documents/destination-directory
```

Once the import job is complete, the import result will be downloaded from S3, extracted, and each document will be uploaded to the specified SharePoint directory.

### Bundle

Create a bundled version of your import script that is compatible with the Import Service.

Add an npm script entry to your Edge Delivery project's `package.json`:

```
"bundle": "aem-import-helper bundle"
```

Run the script:

```
npm run bundle -- --importjs tools/importer/import.js
```

The `import.js` file you provide will be bundled with any locally referenced scripts and saved to a new file named `import.bundle.js`.

### Assistant

Run AI-enabled commands to assist with your import script development.

Add an npm script entry to your Edge Delivery project's `package.json`:

```
"assistant": "aem-import-helper assistant"
```

See [Import Assistant](./docs/import-assistant.md) for usage.

### Importing content into AEM

Add the npm script entries to your Edge Delivery project's `package.json`:

```
"aem-login": "aem-import-helper aem login"
"aem-upload": "aem-import-helper aem upload"
```
`aem-login`: Authenticates with your AEM Cloud Service environment.
`aem-upload`: Uploads content packages and associated assets to AEM.

1. Run the following command to log in to your AEM environment::

```
npm run aem-login -- --aemurl https://author-env-url/
```

* You will be prompted to enter your username and password.
* Once validated, your credentials will be securely stored in an encrypted format and used for future interactions.

```
✔ Enter your AEM username: admin
✔ Enter your AEM password:
Validating credentials...
Saving credentials...
Login successful! Credentials saved securely.
```

2. Run the following command to upload content package (JCR pages) and asociated images to your AEM author:
```
npm run aem-upload
```

You’ll be prompted to provide the following details:
* Absolute Path to the Content Package: Path to the .zip file containing JCR pages, generated by the importer tool.
* Absolute Path to the Image Mapping File: Path to jcr-image-mappings.json, which contains mappings for images and their corresponding JCR paths.
* Site Name: The site name (must match the one provided during import).

```
Checking for credentials...
✔ Enter the absolute path to the content package: /Users/maji/Desktop/test/xwalkdemo.zip
✔ Enter the absolute path to the jcr-image-mappings.json file: /Users/maji/Desktop/test/jcr-image-mappings.json
✔ Enter the site name: xwalkdemo
```

Ensure that the content and images are successfully uploaded to your AEM instance. Verify the uploaded content through your AEM Author environment.
